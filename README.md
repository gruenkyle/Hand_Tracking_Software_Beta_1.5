# Hand_Tracking_Software_Beta_1.5

HandTracking Translator Software

-> Version 1.5 Beta which is the skeleton of each function i'd like to implement

All Scripts are still being developed outside the base skeleton of each idea. 

- Original Idea was to create an ASL translator, and then developed into other small functions

SignLanguage_Project - Script which takes in HandTrackingModule and creates a trackable frame of each finger
  This is then used alongside the folder of pictures to display on screen the translation of each letter 
  that is shown on screen

HandTrackingModule - Background script which tracks and places dots on each joint point within hand
  is used throughout each other script

HandControlVolume - In Progress : Display is functional but volume control is still being finished

HandTracking_Import - Minimal framwork to tracking of individual points on hand which can be imported to 
  other python scripts as starting code
  
HandTrackingMin - Minimum code needed to show frame rate, and position within window
